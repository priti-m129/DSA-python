Your task is very simple: given two integers 
A and B, write a program to add these two numbers and output the sum.
Input Format
The first line contains an integer 
T, the total number of test cases.
Then follow
T lines, each line contains two integers,A and B
Output Format
For each test case, add
B and display the sum in a new line.'''
Code:
t = int(input())
for i in range(0,t):
    a,b = map(int,input().split())
    # write your code here
    print(a+b)
